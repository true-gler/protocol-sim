# protocol-sim

## Implementation
This software can be used to simulate anonymity network protocols.
The goal was to provide a tool to empirically analyze anonymization protocols .
One can run simulations on the pre defined network and perform attack sczenarios on the protocols in order to find possible (unknown) security issues.

## CROWDS
As an example-protocol, CROWDS, is implemented with Dijkstra Algorithm to find the Path through the network.
The simulator was designed with respect to extend it easily by further protocols.

Outcome: 
We successfully have prooven that the CROWDS protocol fulfills the assumptions in terms of
